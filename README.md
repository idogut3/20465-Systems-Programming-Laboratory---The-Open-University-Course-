# 20465-Systems-Programming-Laboratory---The-Open-University-Course-
This is a systems programming laboratory course I took at the "Open university of Israel", the repository contains course assignments (mmns) and the final project of the course. Credit to Omrie Kalil for working with me on the final project.

The final project was to build an assembler to an assembly-like language. A program which reades out assembly code and outputs the machine code for the computer to read, understand and run.
 
here is a picture of what it is supposed to do:
